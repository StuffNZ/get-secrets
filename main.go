      - Use the correct library to get them
      - Validate / convert to an internal representation -- use Viper + GoDotEnv?
      - Create a .env file in /secrets, as well as export them as Env Vars?

     - Viper is used to get settings from a local config file, flags, env-vars, etc. The above CLI flags are representations of this.
     - All the above support [--dotenv-file ${Path}] [--export-env] for the export options
